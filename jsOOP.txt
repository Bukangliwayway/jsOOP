Well I just paused as I realized I can do the explanation on the comment instead.

BASIC LITERALS
declaring the primitive as new makes it object
ex: const s = new String("Hello");
That's an object already
CONSTRUCTOR
the function will on be a constructor if you add 'new' before you declare it
book1 = book(property1,property2) //this is only a function
book2 = new book(property1, property2) //this is now a constructor
